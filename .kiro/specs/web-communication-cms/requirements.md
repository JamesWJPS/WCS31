# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Web Communication system is a content management system designed specifically for Town and Parish Councils to provide WCAG 2.2 accessible websites. The system enables non-technical users to easily manage content through a template-based approach, while providing robust document management capabilities. Built as a headless CMS with a React frontend, the system offers role-based access control and seamless content editing without requiring backend access for end users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a council administrator, I want to manage the entire CMS system including user accounts and permissions, so that I can maintain control over who can access and modify content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator logs in THEN the system SHALL provide access to all administrative functions including user management, content management, and system settings
2. WHEN an administrator creates a new user account THEN the system SHALL allow assignment of permission levels (administrator, editor, or read-only)
3. WHEN an administrator modifies user permissions THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the new access restrictions
4. WHEN an administrator deletes a user account THEN the system SHALL revoke all access and maintain audit trail of the action

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content editor, I want to add and edit website content through an intuitive interface, so that I can keep council information current without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an editor logs into the frontend THEN the system SHALL provide access to content editing tools appropriate to their permission level
2. WHEN an editor creates new content THEN the system SHALL apply the selected template and validate content structure
3. WHEN an editor saves content changes THEN the system SHALL immediately update the live website
4. WHEN an editor accesses the content management interface THEN the system SHALL provide WYSIWYG editing capabilities
5. IF an editor attempts to access administrative functions THEN the system SHALL deny access and display appropriate messaging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to access council information and public documents easily, so that I can stay informed about local government activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor accesses the website THEN the system SHALL display content that meets WCAG 2.2 accessibility standards
2. WHEN a visitor navigates the site THEN the system SHALL provide consistent template-based layout and navigation
3. WHEN a visitor accesses public document folders THEN the system SHALL display available documents with appropriate metadata
4. IF a visitor attempts to access private documents THEN the system SHALL deny access without revealing document existence

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a council staff member, I want to organize documents in folders with privacy controls, so that I can manage both public and confidential information appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads documents THEN the system SHALL allow organization into folder structures
2. WHEN a user sets folder privacy settings THEN the system SHALL enforce public or private access accordingly
3. WHEN a user marks a folder as public THEN the system SHALL make all contained documents accessible to website visitors
4. WHEN a user marks a folder as private THEN the system SHALL restrict access to authenticated users with appropriate permissions
5. WHEN a user searches for documents THEN the system SHALL return results filtered by their access permissions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a council administrator, I want the system to use templates for consistent presentation, so that our website maintains professional appearance without requiring design skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is created THEN the system SHALL apply predefined templates that ensure WCAG 2.2 compliance
2. WHEN templates are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically apply changes to existing content using those templates
3. WHEN a user selects content type THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate template options
4. WHEN content is published THEN the system SHALL validate template compliance before making content live

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want backend access for system maintenance and data management, so that I can resolve technical issues and maintain system integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer accesses the backend THEN the system SHALL provide administrative tools for data management and error resolution
2. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information accessible through backend interfaces
3. WHEN data integrity issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide tools for data validation and correction
4. IF end users encounter technical problems THEN the system SHALL allow developers to investigate and resolve issues through backend access

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the frontend and backend to be clearly separated, so that content management can occur without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN the frontend SHALL operate independently as a React application consuming headless CMS APIs
2. WHEN users perform content operations THEN the system SHALL handle all interactions through the frontend interface
3. WHEN content is modified THEN the system SHALL communicate changes through API calls to the headless CMS backend
4. WHEN system updates occur THEN the frontend and backend SHALL maintain compatibility through versioned API interfaces

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a read-only user, I want to view content and documents within my permissions, so that I can access necessary information without risk of accidental modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a read-only user logs in THEN the system SHALL provide view access to content and documents within their permissions
2. WHEN a read-only user attempts to edit content THEN the system SHALL prevent modifications and display read-only interfaces
3. WHEN a read-only user accesses documents THEN the system SHALL allow viewing and downloading of permitted files
4. IF a read-only user attempts unauthorized actions THEN the system SHALL maintain security while providing clear feedback about access limitations
