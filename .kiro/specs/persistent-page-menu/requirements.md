# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhancement ensures that the page menu navigation is consistently available to users regardless of their authentication status. Currently, the site shows different interfaces for logged-in administrators versus public visitors, which can make it difficult for users to see how their site is building up during content creation. By maintaining a persistent page menu, users can experience a consistent navigation structure that helps them visualize their site's organization and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want to see the same page menu structure when logged in as when logged out, so that I can understand how visitors will experience my site navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator is logged in THEN the system SHALL display the same page menu structure that public visitors see
2. WHEN an administrator is logged in THEN the system SHALL show the page menu alongside admin tools, not replace it
3. WHEN an administrator navigates between pages using the menu THEN the system SHALL maintain the admin interface context
4. WHEN an administrator creates or modifies content THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect changes in the visible page menu

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want to access admin functions while viewing the public page menu, so that I can efficiently manage content without losing sight of the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator is logged in THEN the system SHALL provide access to content editing functions from the page menu interface
2. WHEN an administrator is viewing a page through the menu THEN the system SHALL display edit controls for that specific page
3. WHEN an administrator is logged in THEN the system SHALL show admin-specific indicators (like draft status, hidden pages) within the page menu
4. WHEN an administrator clicks on admin functions THEN the system SHALL maintain the current page context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want the page menu to show real-time updates, so that I can immediately see how changes affect the site structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator publishes or unpublishes content THEN the system SHALL immediately update the page menu visibility
2. WHEN an administrator reorders menu items THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect the new order in the page menu
3. WHEN an administrator changes page titles or menu titles THEN the system SHALL immediately update the displayed menu text
4. WHEN an administrator creates new content THEN the system SHALL immediately add it to the page menu if it's set to show in menu

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want to distinguish between public and admin-only elements in the menu, so that I can understand what visitors will see versus what's available only to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator views the page menu THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish draft content from published content
2. WHEN an administrator views the page menu THEN the system SHALL visually indicate pages that are hidden from public view
3. WHEN an administrator views the page menu THEN the system SHALL show admin-only controls (edit, delete) only when logged in
4. WHEN a public visitor views the page menu THEN the system SHALL hide all admin-specific indicators and controls
