# Admin Panel Access Fix

## Issue
The admin control panel was moved to `/admin` prefix during the menu management implementation, breaking existing admin access.

## Solution
Restored the original admin routing structure while adding public content functionality:

### Current Routing Structure

#### Admin Routes (Original paths restored)
- `/` → Redirects to `/dashboard`
- `/dashboard` → Admin Dashboard with menu management
- `/content` → Content management
- `/documents` → Document management  
- `/users` → User management
- `/preview` → Site preview with "View Live Site" button

#### Public Routes (New)
- `/public` → Public content display (auto-selects first page)
- `/public/:slug` → Public content by slug (e.g., `/public/about-us`)

### Navigation Between Admin and Public

#### From Admin to Public
- **Site Preview page**: Click "View Live Site" button
- **Direct URL**: Navigate to `/public` or `/public/page-slug`

#### From Public to Admin
- **Admin access bar**: Click "Admin Panel" button in top-right
- **Direct URL**: Navigate to `/dashboard` or any admin route

### Key Features Preserved
- ✅ Original admin panel access at root paths
- ✅ Menu management with drag & drop
- ✅ Slug-based public content routing
- ✅ Real-time content updates
- ✅ All existing admin functionality

### URLs Summary
```
Admin Panel:
- /dashboard (main admin)
- /content (content management)
- /documents (file management)
- /users (user management)
- /preview (site preview)

Public Site:
- /public (public homepage)
- /public/about-us (example page)
- /public/contact (example page)
```

The admin control panel is now fully accessible at the original URLs, and the new public content system works alongside it without conflicts.
